I've been using Visual Studio Code now for over a year and absolutely love the productivity it's given me.  Previously, my go to editor was Visual Studio 2015, mostly due to working with ASP.NET Web Forms.  Now that I'm focusing more on front end development and Angular, I don't think I'd start a new project without VS Code by my side.

## Here's a list of my Top 10 Angular VS Code Extensions

#10 [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)
Keep your sanity when working with brackets and braces.  Extremely useful while navigating code with mulitple arrow functions.

#9 [HTML CSS Class Completion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion)
Perfect for quickly decorating HTML with the project's available class names.  Unfortunately, the class names are not scoped to the component's folder.

#8 [Angular 2 TypeScript Emmet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakethashi.vscode-angular2-emmet)
If you haven't learned Emmet yet it's definitely something to put under your belt.  This plugin allows you to use the syntax directly in component templates.

#5 [vscode-Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons)

#4 [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)
If you're not linting TypeScript you should start, especially with [codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer).  This plugin makes it dead simple to see issues in you TypeScript code.  It even provides auto fixes!

#3 [Angular 2+ Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Mikael.Angular-BeastCode)
This is the most comprehensive snippet pack I've seen.  It features 67 different snippets.

#2 [TypeScript Hero](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rbbit.typescript-hero)
This plugin manages import statements and can automatically import missing dependencies.  Can organize and sort imports.

#1 [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
If there's one plugin you add make sure it's this one.  This plugin enables autocompletion to file paths, which provides a huge boost when dealing with import statements.
